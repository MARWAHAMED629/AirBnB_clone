The task is to build the front-end prototype for an AirBnB clone web application. It's designed to be completed in steps, starting with simple HTML pages and progressively adding layers of complexity using CSS.

Here's a breakdown of the tasks:

Step 1-3: These tasks focus on basic HTML and CSS structure. You'll learn how to:

Create header and footer sections with specific colors and heights.
Use inline and external styles to control the layout.
Ensure the code is valid and well-organized.
Step 4-6: These tasks introduce filters and interactivity. You'll learn how to:

Add a search bar with a button and use CSS to change its appearance on hover.
Create filter sections with dropdown menus using lists and nested elements.
Implement basic interaction with the filters (e.g., displaying/hiding dropdown menus).
Step 7-8: These tasks focus on displaying search results. You'll learn how to:

Create listings for "Places" with appropriate titles, descriptions, and prices.
Add additional details like guest capacity, bedrooms, and bathrooms.
Use icons and borders to improve visual clarity and organization.
Step 9-10 (Advanced): These tasks require deeper understanding of advanced CSS techniques. You'll learn how to:

Organize "Place" listings using Flexbox for responsive layout and alignment.
Add more details like amenities and reviews, including formatting for user names and dates.
Step 11-12 (Advanced): These tasks focus on accessibility and responsiveness. You'll learn how to:

Ensure proper color contrast and keyboard navigation for accessibility.
Adapt the layout and styles for different screen sizes (e.g., mobile devices).
